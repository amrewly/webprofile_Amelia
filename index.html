                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Greetings! My name is Amelia Ismania, born on August 1, 2002, in Sragen, Central Java. I have a profound passion for reading, writing, and drawing. When it comes to food, my absolute favorite is noodles, while my go-to drinks are chocolate milk and anything with a hint of chocolate flavor. I have a soft spot for chocolate ice cream as well.
                        <br>
                        Currently, I reside in Pekanbaru, where I embarked on my educational journey. I started my education at a local kindergarten in Pekanbaru and continued my elementary schooling in this vibrant city. As I progressed to middle school and high school, I decided to challenge myself by attending a boarding school located in West Sumatra.
                        <br>
                        My pursuit of knowledge led me to Muhammadiyah University in Riau, where I am currently in my fifth semester. It's been an incredible journey thus far, and I'm excited to see where it leads next.
                        <br>
                        I'm deeply passionate about personal growth and creativity, always seeking new experiences and challenges. My diverse educational background has allowed me to learn, adapt, and thrive in various environments. I look forward to the next chapters of my life's adventure and the opportunities to learn, create, and make a positive impact.
                        <br>
                        Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. Feel free to reach out or connect with me as I continue on this remarkable journey.</p>
